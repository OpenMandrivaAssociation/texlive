-% SELFAUTO{LOC,DIR,AUTO}, look in the directory,
-% then the subdirectories share/texmf-local and share/texmf,
-% then ./texmf-local and ./texmf.

-% However, we want to include one more directory: the

-% /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/texmf.cnf.  I.e., not under YYYY.

-% As a result, we cannot use actual brace expansion in the definition,
-% since we don't want to scatter ../'s throughout the value.  Hence we
-% explicitly list every directory.  Arguably more understandable this
